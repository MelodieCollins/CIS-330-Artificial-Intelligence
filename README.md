# CIS-330-Artificial-Intelligence
This program implements a simple AI that does the following
  a) accepts three arguments:
        i) first argument: a text file that contains a list of tuples that are <keyword responseword happiness>

        ii) second argument: a text file that contains a N messages

        iii) third argument: a text file where the output will be stored

    b) After reading in the first text file, it will go through each message in the second file, and if the message contains one of the 'keywords' from the first file, it will immediately respond with the appropriate message (depending on whether the corresponding 'keyword' makes the AI happy or not), along with the corresponding 'response' word. If more than one 'keyword' is included in the message, multiple responses will be made.
